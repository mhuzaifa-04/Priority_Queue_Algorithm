# Priority Queue Operations  

## 📌 Introduction  
A **Priority Queue** is a type of queue in which each element has a **priority**.  
Elements with higher priority are dequeued before elements with lower priority.  

Common real-life examples:  
- Emergency room patient management.  
- Task scheduling in operating systems.  
- Bandwidth allocation in networks.
